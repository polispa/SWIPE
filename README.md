# SWIPE
SWIPE game Manche Open School.

Hey, if you read this it means the push from a local machine worked. Yay.

A basic game made by the 2017 Manche Open school session to test their skills
in dev and github.

Rules are simple : Follow the written instruction and press the correct arrow
button on your keyboard.

Be careful, though : The game can be unfair...
